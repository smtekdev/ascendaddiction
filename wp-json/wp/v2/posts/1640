It can be alcohol, opioids, or another substance, but dependence will make you feel that your brain is permanently programmed to remain dependent.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is a strong, scientifically proven fact, which gives hope: your brain is changeable.<\/p>\n<p>Neuroplasticity &#8211; the marvelous power of the brain to restructure itself by creating new neural connections &#8211; is a challenge to the traditional perception that the adult brain is immutable. Nowadays, we know that the brain is constantly developing. And this is the most important thing for recovering from addiction.<\/p>\n<p>The brain&#8217;s reward and decision-making systems change in strong, unwanted ways when people use drugs. But with focused effort and certain activities, we can use the neuroplasticity of addiction to physically rewire the Brain so that it is healthy and sober. Using neuroplasticity, recovery goes well beyond just quitting substance use to establish a happy, drug-free life.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Move Your Body: The Power of Aerobic Exercise<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Workout is likely what would work like a magic bullet for neuroplasticity. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a protein secreted during neuroplasticity exercises, and particularly cardio-based exercise, that helps the brain to stay healthy.<\/p>\n<p>Why is BDNF important for addiction recovery?<\/p>\n<p>Just think of BDNF as nutrition for the brain. It maintains the health of the existing neurons, encourages the new ones, and is critical in the formation of the pathways that keep you sober. Exercise also decreases stress and anxiety, which are major relapse triggers, and replenishes cellular damage caused by prolonged drug use.<\/p>\n<p>Actionable Tip: Aim to do <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/ascendaddictionneurorecovery.com\/how-does-aerobic-exercise-compare-to-mindfulness-meditation-in-stimulating-neuroplasticity\/\">aerobic exercise<\/a><\/span> at a moderate level five times a week for at least 30 minutes each time. Good options are walking, jogging, and swimming. This planned behavior is a direct way to help people heal from addiction through neuroplasticity.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Feed Your Mind: Targeted Nutrition and Diet<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;You are what you eat&#8221; is a very true saying when it comes to addiction and learning. The brain only takes up about 20 percent of your oxygen and calories, yet it is only 2 percent of your body weight. It needs quality fuel to make healthy changes.<\/p>\n<p>Consumption of certain nutrients and foods can significantly improve the healing capacity of the brain:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids<\/strong>: They are present in fatty fish like salmon and in walnuts, flaxseed, and other plant sources. It helps in the process of communication between neurons.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Antioxidants<\/strong>: They are also found in dark leafy greens, colorful fruits and vegetables, and berries. Drug abuse can make oxidative stress worse, but these things fight it and protect brain cells.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Probiotics<\/strong>: Foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, and kombucha are rich in probiotics. Probiotics have a direct impact on brain health through the gut-brain axis.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A healthy gut balances the mood, curbs inflammation, and, therefore, facilitates recovery and neuroplasticity.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Practice Mindfulness and Meditation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most powerful ways to help people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol heal.<\/p>\n<p>The brain in active addiction is responsive; there is a trigger, desire, and compulsivity to reinforce the harmful routes.<\/p>\n<p>This cycle is helpful through mindfulness training, which is one of the core components of the therapy. It thickens the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that controls self-control, planning, and the execution of functions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Boost Neuroplasticity by Learning New Skills<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Do guided meditation or focused breathing for just 5\u201310 minutes a day to start. Neuroplasticity works best when things are always the same.<\/p>\n<p>Take on a cognitive challenge and learn a new skill.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to rewire the brain, you have to push it. The best way to stimulate neuroplasticity is to learn something new. Mastering a different language, playing a musical instrument, or making a difficult puzzle compels the brain to make new connections and strengthen the old ones.<\/p>\n<p>This actively fights the &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode that drug abuse makes people use. It offers productive, pleasant attention-seeking and distraction from old, negative paths of substance use.<\/p>\n<p>That is why it helps to recover; it enhances self-efficacy and brain reserve. Learning a new skill well boosts a person&#8217;s confidence and shows them that they can learn and make changes, which is a very important idea for long-term recovery from addiction.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Embrace Supportive, Healthy Relationships<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are deep neural roots to this idea, even though it may seem like a social one. The importance of human connection: our brains handle social relationships through hormones such as Oxytocin.<\/p>\n<p>Stress, which makes cortisol and fights neurogenesis, is common in toxic relationships. On the other hand, having healthy, helpful relationships can really help you deal with stress and loneliness, which are two main things that lead to relapse.<\/p>\n<p>Being observed, heard, and encouraged by others, you will remain emotionally stable and develop healthy behavioral norms. The sense of being secure and trusting is therapy in itself; bonding becomes stronger, and the desire to self-medicate and to have approval with drugs is lessened.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Start Your Journey with Science-Based Healing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Getting over an addiction is a long process, but learning about neuroplasticity and addiction recovery can help you get there. It shows you that you didn&#8217;t have any fault; you only need the appropriate tools and environment to repair and make things better.<\/p>\n<p>We at <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/ascendaddictionneurorecovery.com\/about-us\/\"><strong>Ascend Addiction NeuroRecovery<\/strong><\/a><\/span> think that using this science leads to long-lasting change.
